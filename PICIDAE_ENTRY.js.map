This is the only work that occurs in the main thread.\n *\n *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks. This\n *    may be done in the worker thread.\n *\n *  - Forward these native events (with the associated top-level type used to\n *    trap it) to `EventPluginHub`, which in turn will ask plugins if they want\n *    to extract any synthetic events.\n *\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` will then process each event by annotating them with\n *    \"dispatches\", a sequence of listeners and IDs that care about that event.\n *\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` then dispatches the events.\n *\n * Overview of React and the event system:\n *\n * +------------+    .\n * |    DOM     |    .\n * +------------+    .\n *       |           .\n *       v           .\n * +------------+    .\n * | ReactEvent |    .\n * |  Listener  |    .\n * +------------+    .                         +-----------+\n *       |           .               +--------+|SimpleEvent|\n *       |           .               |         |Plugin     |\n * +-----|------+    .               v         +-----------+\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+                    +------------+\n * |     +-----------.--->|EventPluginHub|                    |    Event   |\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  | Propagators|\n * | ReactEvent |    .    |              |     |TapEvent   |  |------------|\n * |  Emitter   |    .    |              |<---+|Plugin     |  |other plugin|\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  |  utilities |\n * |     +-----------.--->|              |                    +------------+\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+\n * +-----|------+    .                ^        +-----------+\n *       |           .                |        |Enter/Leave|\n *       +           .                +-------+|Plugin     |\n * +-------------+   .                         +-----------+\n * | application |   .\n * |-------------|   .\n * |             |   .\n * |             |   .\n * +-------------+   .\n *                   .\n *    React Core     .

The curried function has two unusual capabilities. First, its\n * arguments needn't be provided one at a time. If `g` is `R.curryN(3, f)`, the\n * following are equivalent:\n *\n *   - `g(1)(2)(3)`\n *   - `g(1)(2, 3)`\n *   - `g(1, 2)(3)`\n *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\n *\n * Secondly, the special placeholder value [`R.__`](#__) may be used to specify\n * \"gaps\", allowing partial application of any combination of arguments,\n * regardless of their positions. If `g` is as above and `_` is [`R.__`](#__),\n * the following are equivalent:\n *\n *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2, 3)(1)`\n *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1)(2)`\n *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1, 2)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(1)(3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(1, 3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(_, 3)(1)`\n *\n * @func\n * @memberOf R\n * @since v0.5.0\n * @category Function\n * @sig Number -> (* -> a) -> (* -> a)\n * @param {Number} length The arity for the returned function.\n * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n * @return {Function} A new, curried function.\n * @see R.curry\n * @example\n *\n *      const sumArgs = (...args) => R.sum(args);\n *\n *      const curriedAddFourNumbers = R.curryN(4, sumArgs);\n *      const f = curriedAddFourNumbers(1, 2);\n *      const g = f(3);\n *      g(4); //=> 10\n */\n\n\nvar curryN =\n/*#__PURE__*/\n_curry2(function curryN(length, fn) {\n  if (length === 1) {\n    return _curry1(fn);\n  }\n\n  return _arity(length, _curryN(length, [], fn));\n});\n\nmodule.exports = curryN;\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ../~/ramda/src/curryN.js\n// module id = 346\n// module chunks = 26","'use strict';\n\nmodule.exports = require('./lib/ReactDOM');\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ../~/react-dom/index.js\n// module id = 347\n// module chunks = 26","/**\n * Copyright (c) 2013-present, Facebook, Inc.\n *\n * This source code is licensed under the MIT license found in the\n * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.\n *\n */\n\n'use strict';\n\n/**\n * CSS properties which accept numbers but are not in units of \"px\".\n */\n\nvar isUnitlessNumber = {\n  animationIterationCount: true,\n  borderImageOutset: true,\n  borderImageSlice: true,\n  borderImageWidth: true,\n  boxFlex: true,\n  boxFlexGroup: true,\n  boxOrdinalGroup: true,\n  columnCount: true,\n  columns: true,\n  flex: true,\n  flexGrow: true,\n  flexPositive: true,\n  flexShrink: true,\n  flexNegative: true,\n  flexOrder: true,\n  gridRow: true,\n  gridRowEnd: true,\n  gridRowSpan: true,\n  gridRowStart: true,\n  gridColumn: true,\n  gridColumnEnd: true,\n  gridColumnSpan: true,\n  gridColumnStart: true,\n  fontWeight: true,\n  lineClamp: true,\n  lineHeight: true,\n  opacity: true,\n  order: true,\n  orphans: true,\n  tabSize: true,\n  widows: true,\n  zIndex: true,\n  zoom: true,\n\n  // SVG-related properties\n  fillOpacity: true,\n  floodOpacity: true,\n  stopOpacity: true,\n  strokeDasharray: true,\n  strokeDashoffset: true,\n  strokeMiterlimit: true,\n  strokeOpacity: true,\n  strokeWidth: true\n};\n\n/**\n * @param {string} prefix vendor-specific prefix, eg: Webkit\n * @param {string} key style name, eg: transitionDuration\n * @return {string} style name prefixed with `prefix`, properly camelCased, eg:\n * WebkitTransitionDuration\n */\nfunction prefixKey(prefix, key) {\n  return prefix + key.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + key.substring(1);\n}\n\n/**\n * Support style names that may come passed in prefixed by adding permutations\n * of vendor prefixes.\n */\nvar prefixes = ['Webkit', 'ms', 'Moz', 'O'];\n\n// Using Object.keys here, or else the vanilla for-in loop makes IE8 go into an\n// infinite loop, because it iterates over the newly added props too.\nObject.keys(isUnitlessNumber).forEach(function (prop) {\n  prefixes.forEach(function (prefix) {\n    isUnitlessNumber[prefixKey(prefix, prop)] = isUnitlessNumber[prop];\n  });\n});\n\n/**\n * Most style properties can be unset by doing .style[prop] = '' but IE8\n * doesn't like doing that with shorthand properties so for the properties that\n * IE8 breaks on, which are listed here, we instead unset each of the\n * individual properties.
